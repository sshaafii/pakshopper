# Cart Functionality Implementation

## Overview
The cart functionality has been successfully implemented and integrated into the PakShopper application. Users can now add products to their cart from the order form and manage multiple orders before checkout.

## How It Works

### 1. Adding Items to Cart
- Users fill out the order form on `/order-form` page
- When they click "Confirm Order", the item is added to their cart
- They are automatically redirected to the cart page (`/cart`)

### 2. Cart Management
- **View Items**: All cart items are displayed with product details, pricing, and order specifications
- **Edit Items**: Users can modify size, color, quantity, and special instructions
- **Remove Items**: Individual items can be removed with confirmation
- **Clear Cart**: Entire cart can be cleared with confirmation dialog

### 3. Cart Features
- **Real-time Calculations**: Prices update automatically when items are modified
- **Currency Conversion**: Support for multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD)
- **Persistent Storage**: Cart data is saved in localStorage and persists between sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
- `frontend/contexts/CartContext.tsx` - Cart state management
- `frontend/app/cart/page.tsx` - Cart page component
- `frontend/app/order-form/page.tsx` - Updated to integrate with cart
- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Added CartProvider wrapper
- `frontend/components/Navbar.tsx` - Added cart icon with item count

### Cart Context Features
- **State Management**: Uses React Context with useReducer for efficient state updates
- **Local Storage**: Automatic persistence of cart data
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic recalculation of totals and currency conversions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

### Navigation Integration
- **Cart Icon**: Added to navbar with item count badge
- **Mobile Support**: Cart link included in mobile navigation menu
- **Breadcrumbs**: Proper navigation flow from order form to cart

## User Experience

### Order Form â†’ Cart Flow
1. User fills out product details
2. Clicks "Confirm Order"

- **Item Cards**: Detailed view of each cart item with edit/remove options
- **Order Summary**: Real-time calculation of totals in multiple currencies
- **Checkout Button**: Ready for future checkout implementation

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Checkout Process**: Payment integration and shipping address collection
- **Order History**: Track previous orders and their status
- **Wishlist**: Save items for later purchase
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple items for batch actions
- **Shipping Calculator**: Real-time shipping cost estimation

### Technical Improvements
- **API Integration**: Connect to backend for persistent cart storage
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live cart updates
- **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling for large carts
- **Analytics**: Track cart abandonment and conversion metrics

## Usage Examples

### Adding Items to Cart
```typescript
const { addItem } = useCart()

addItem({
  productData: { name: 'Product', brand: 'Brand', url: 'url', basePrice: 1000, currency: 'PKR' },
  orderDetails: { size: 'M', quantity: 1, color: 'Blue', specialInstructions: '', customMeasurements: null },
  selectedQC: qualityControlOption,
  shippingMethod: 'standard',
  totalInPKR: 1200,
  totalInSelectedCurrency: 4.32
})
```

### Accessing Cart State
```typescript
const { state } = useCart()
const { items, totalItems, subtotalPKR } = state
```

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Add Item**: Fill order form and verify item appears in cart
2. **Edit Item**: Modify cart item details and verify updates
3. **Remove Item**: Delete items and verify cart updates
4. **Clear Cart**: Clear entire cart and verify empty state
5. **Currency Switch**: Change currency and verify conversions
6. **Persistence**: Refresh page and verify cart data remains

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Local storage support required

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Cart Not Persisting**: Check if localStorage is enabled
- **Currency Not Updating**: Verify currency rates are properly configured
- **Items Not Adding**: Check if CartProvider is wrapping the app
- **Navigation Errors**: Ensure all routes are properly configured

### Debug Information
- Cart state is logged to console during development
- Local storage key: `pakshopper-cart`
- Cart context provides full state access for debugging
